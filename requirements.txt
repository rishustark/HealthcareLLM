# Core ML/NLP Libraries
torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu # Or specific CUDA version
transformers>=4.30.0 # Use a recent version compatible with PEFT/QLoRA
datasets>=2.10.0
accelerate>=0.21.0 # Required for efficient training

# PEFT Libraries
peft>=0.5.0 # For LoRA/QLoRA support
bitsandbytes>=0.41.0 # For 4-bit quantization (QLoRA) - Linux/CUDA often required

# Utilities
tqdm # Progress bars
fire # Command-line interface helper

# Optional for Evaluation/Metrics (if using text generation metrics)
# rouge_score
# bert_score
# nltk # Often needed for tokenization in metrics

# Note: Installation of bitsandbytes might require specific CUDA versions
# and may be easier on Linux environments. Check their documentation.
# Ensure PyTorch is installed correctly for your hardware (CPU/GPU).
